## Current Projects

### Object 6D Pose Estimation

I am currently learning and exploring both traditional and modern ways of estimating object's 6d pose, more specifically in robot manipulation. **[WIP]**

### Robotic Manipulators (Fanuc Robotic Arm)

I am currently working on developing the robot model and high level software control for Fanuc Robotic arm (LR Mate 200iD 4s model). Documentation and demo can be seen here: <a href="https://github.com/logeshg2/LR_Mate_200iD_4S-Robot-Model/" target="_blank">Project Repo</a> .
