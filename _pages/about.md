### Robotic Manipulators

![scara_gif](/assets/images/scara.gif)

I am currently working on robotic manipulators, specifically focusing on the visual perception component of a robotic arm. My work involves implementing hand-eye calibration techniques, such as the TSAI method from the OpenCV library and object manipulation tasks. Additionally, I am exploring learning-based approaches for object manipulation, utilizing deep reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and Vision-Language Actions (VLAs).
