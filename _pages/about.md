### Robotic Manipulators

![moveo](/assets/images/scara.gif)

I am currently working on robotic manipulators, specifically focusing on the visual perception component of a robotic arm. My work involves implementing object detection algorithms, grasp pose estimation algorithms and 3D perception for robotic manipulators. Additionally, I am exploring learning-based approaches for object manipulation, utilizing deep reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and Vision-Language Actions (VLAs).
